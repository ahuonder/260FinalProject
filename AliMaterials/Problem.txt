Write an assembly program that does UPPERCASE the input sentence in a string 
similar to an UPPERCASE feature in the office word. Assume the given string 
consists of (for example) two words separated by a space, where each word has 
at least one upper- and lower-case character. The sentence could be included
any character on the keyboard consisting of a-z, A-Z, 0-9, and ~…+. For instance, 
if the input is "the input sentence\n", your program should successively change
this sentence to "THE INPUT SENTENCE\n". Be sure to test your program using 
diﬀerent sentences. 

Be sure to test your program using diﬀerent sentences of different lengths. Make 
sure you can understand the maximum size of the sentences that your program 
accepts and why is this length.
